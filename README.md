<p>I have developed a spam detector program in Python which classifies given emails as spam or ham using the Naive Bayes approach.</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>

<p>This Project includes 3 executable files, 3 text files as well as 2 directories as follows:</p>
<h4>Executable Files:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>spam_detector.py</b> - Includes all functions required for classification operations.</li>
  <li><b>train.py</b> - Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and generates the model.txt file after execution.</li>
  <li><b>test.py</b> - Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and, after execution, generates the result.txt as well as evaluation.txt files.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Output Files:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>model.txt</b> - Contains information about the vocabularies of the train set, such as the frequency and conditional probability of each word in Spam and Ham classes.</li>
  <li><b>result.txt</b> - Contains information about the classified emails of the test set.</li>
  <li><b>evaluation.txt</b> - Contains evaluation results table as well as Confusion Matrix of Spam and Ham classes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Source Directories:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>train directory</b> - Includes all emails for the training phase of the program.</li>
  <li><b>test directory</b> - Includes all emails for the testing phase of the program.</li>
</ul>
