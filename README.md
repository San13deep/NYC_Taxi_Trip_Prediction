# NYC Taxi Trip Prediction
# Problem Description
Task is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

# Approch:
After loading the given dataset its observed that given dataset has more than 14 lac records and 11 columns. The main goal of this project to predict the trip duration for 2 vendors. To get more insights about the dataset, performed Exploratory data analysis to understand the main characteristics of various features. Using existing features, created new features for model building and to interpret data more easily. After analyzing the dataset, itâ€™s found that there was some inconsistent data entries in some features. The passenger count was high like 7 to 9 passengers in taxi. The travelled distance is very less but trip duration is quite high. There were outliers in many features and after analyzing the data, those outliers removed and dataset prepared for model building.
